# 🚀 Claude Code Scaffold: From Idea to Production in Hours

**The fastest way to build production-ready applications with Claude Code.** 

Stop wrestling with boilerplate, authentication setup, payment integration, and deployment configuration. Start building features that matter.

## 💡 The Problem with Modern Development

Building a SaaS application today means:
- ⏱️ **Weeks of setup** before writing your first feature
- 🔐 **Authentication complexity** with roles, permissions, and JWT handling
- 💳 **Payment integration headaches** with subscriptions and webhooks
- 🚀 **Deployment infrastructure** with staging, production, and CI/CD
- 📊 **Database design** and migration management
- 🔧 **Configuration management** across multiple services

**What if you could skip all of that and focus on your unique value proposition?**

## ✨ The Claude Code Scaffold Solution

**One command. Complete application. Production ready.**

```bash
# Install once
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nisbus/claude-scaffold/main/scripts/install-scaffold-system.sh | bash

# Build anything
/scaffold new my-saas-app
```

Claude Code handles everything:
- 🏗️ **Full-stack architecture** (Frontend + Backend + Database)
- 🔐 **Authentication & authorization** (Auth0 with roles)
- 💳 **Payment processing** (Stripe with subscriptions)
- 🚀 **Multi-environment deployment** (Staging + Production)
- ⚡ **CI/CD pipelines** (GitHub Actions)
- 📱 **Modern frameworks** (Next.js, React, your choice of backend)

## 🎯 Who This Is For

**Experienced developers who value their time.** You know how to build software, but you're tired of:
- Setting up the same infrastructure repeatedly
- Fighting with OAuth flows and JWT tokens
- Configuring Stripe webhooks for the hundredth time
- Writing deployment scripts instead of features

**This is not another tutorial or template.** It's a complete automation system that leverages Claude's intelligence to build exactly what you need.

## 🏆 Real Results

From our testing and community feedback:

- ⚡ **2 hours**: Idea to deployed SaaS application
- 🎨 **Zero boilerplate**: Every line of code serves your business logic
- 🔒 **Enterprise-grade**: Security, scalability, and monitoring built-in
- 💰 **Cost-effective**: Optimized for development and production efficiency

## 🤝 Built by the Community, for the Community

**We need your expertise!** This project thrives on contributions from developers who understand what makes development truly productive.

### 🛠️ Current Stack Support
- **Frontend**: Next.js, React
- **Backend**: Erlang/OTP, Node.js, Python
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (Render, Neon)
- **Auth**: Auth0
- **Payments**: Stripe
- **Deployment**: Render

### 🎯 We're Looking For

```

### How It Works

1. **Command Registration**: Run `scripts/register-scaffold-command.sh` to register the `/scaffold` command with Claude Code
2. **Command Invocation**: Use `/scaffold new my-app` or `/scaffold existing` in Claude Code
3. **Project Setup**: The scaffold script creates the project structure and copies all necessary files
4. **MCP Configuration**: Local `.claude/mcp_settings.json` is created with all required MCP servers
5. **Claude Instructions**: A project-specific `CLAUDE.md` is generated to guide Claude through the setup
6. **Service Initialization**: Claude follows the workflow to set up all services (Render, Auth0, Stripe, GitHub)
7. **Deployment**: Applications are deployed to staging and production environments

## 🚀 Features

- **Full-Stack Setup**: Frontend (Next.js/React) + Backend (Erlang/Node.js/Python)
- **Authentication**: Auth0 integration with role-based access control
- **Payments**: Stripe subscription management
- **Database**: Render PostgreSQL or Neon with automatic schema setup
- **Deployment**: Render services with staging and production environments
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions workflows for automated testing and deployment
- **Infrastructure as Code**: All services configured programmatically

## ⏱️ Time to Production

With Claude Code Scaffold, you can go from idea to deployed application in:
- **Initial Setup**: 5 minutes (one-time)
- **Project Creation**: 2 minutes
- **Service Configuration**: 15 minutes
- **Basic Features**: 30-60 minutes
- **Deployment**: 10 minutes

**Total: Under 2 hours for a production-ready application!**

## 📖 Complete Workflow Story

**[Read the full story: From Idea to Production](docs/WORKFLOW_STORY.md)** - Follow Sarah as she builds "PlantCare", a SaaS application, from concept to deployment in just 2 hours. Includes:
- Step-by-step walkthrough with real commands
- Best practices for prompting Claude
- Common workflows and pro tips
- Complete example from database design to production deployment

## 🎯 Quick Start

### System Installation (One-time)

Install the scaffold system globally for your user:

```bash
# Install directly from GitHub
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nisbus/claude-scaffold/main/scripts/install-scaffold-system.sh | bash

# Or clone and install locally
git clone https://github.com/nisbus/claude-scaffold.git
cd claude-scaffold
./scripts/install-scaffold-system.sh

# Restart Claude Code for changes to take effect
```

This installs the scaffold system to `~/.claude-scaffold` and registers the `/scaffold` command globally.

### New Project

In Claude Code, use the registered command:
```
/scaffold new my-awesome-app
```

Or ask Claude naturally:
```
"Please scaffold a new project called my-awesome-app"
```

### Existing Project

Navigate to your project directory, then in Claude Code:
```
/scaffold existing
```

Or ask Claude:
```
"Please scaffold this existing project with auth, payments, and deployment"
```

## 🔧 Configuration Options

### Backend Languages
- **Erlang** (default) - Cowboy framework, OTP, high concurrency
- **Node.js** - Express.js, familiar JavaScript

## 🤖 Claude Code Integration

### Manual Command
When prompted, Claude Code will execute:
```
claude-code scaffold new [project-name]
```

### Claude Code Instructions
The system provides Claude Code with:
- Step-by-step scaffolding workflow
- Service configuration templates
- Code generation patterns
- Validation procedures

### Interactive Flow
1. Claude Code reads `scaffold/CLAUDE.md` for instructions

- Use GitHub Actions secrets for CI/CD
- Local `.env.local` added to `.gitignore`

### Authentication
- JWT validation on all API endpoints
- Role-based access control
- Secure session management
- Regular token rotation

### Database
- SSL/TLS connections required
- Connection pooling
- Row-level security
- Regular automated backups

## ⚠️ Technical Notes

### SPA Routing Configuration
For single-page applications with client-side routing and Auth0 authentication, configure URL rewrites:

**render.yaml (Recommended)**:
```yaml
services:
  - type: static
    name: your-app-frontend
    routes:
      - type: rewrite
        source: /*
        destination: /index.html
```

**_redirects file**:
Place in your public directory:
```
/*    /index.html   200
```

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Customize** - Update branding, styling, and business logic
2. **Configure** - Set up custom domains and SSL
3. **Monitor** - Configure alerting and logging
4. **Scale** - Optimize performance and costs
5. **Secure** - Implement additional security measures
